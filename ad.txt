Callback:
 promises, and async/await are all mechanisms in JavaScript 
 (and other programming languages) used to handle asynchronous 
 operations. Let's break down the concepts and discuss their 
 advantages and disadvantages.

Callbacks:
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, 
which are then executed once an asynchronous operation completes. 
They are the traditional way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.
 
 WHAT IS Callback
 ================  PASS A FUNCTION WITHIN A FUNCTION AS A PARAMETER.S

Advantages of Callbacks:
========================

Simplicity: Callbacks are straightforward to understand and use.
Good for control flow: They can handle complex control flow in certain scenarios
.
Disadvantages of Callbacks:
===========================
Callback hell (Pyramid of Doom): When dealing with multiple nested asynchronous
 operations, the code can become hard to read and maintain.
Error handling can be challenging: Error propagation can be cumbersome.
Lack of sequential readability: Code can become less sequential and harder to follow.
Promises:
Promises were introduced to address the issues with callback-based code. A Promise 
represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved or rejected
 at some point in the future.
